- ✅ Cal.com (scheduling)
- ✅ Notion (CRM)
- ✅ CRM Backend (optional - for external CRM integration)

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Server Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Test Complete Flow
1. Start server: `python backend/main.py`
2. Start ngrok: `ngrok http 8000`
3. Configure Twilio with ngrok URL
4. Call: +1 (814) 568-5796
5. Have a conversation with Nova
6. Book an appointment
7. Check SMS, Cal.com, and Notion

## 📊 What to Watch

When you call, watch the terminal for:
```
📞 Incoming call: CA...
🗣️  User said: Hi, I need help
🤖 Nova says: Great! Can I get your name?
📊 Extracted: {'name': 'John'}
📅 Booking: Yes
✅ SMS sent!
✅ Notion lead created!
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "ModuleNotFoundError"
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Address already in use"
```bash
# Kill process on port 8000
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
```

### Nova doesn't respond
- Check OpenAI API key in .env
- Check you have OpenAI credits
- Look at terminal for errors

### No SMS received
- Check phone number format: +1XXXXXXXXXX
- Verify Twilio number is SMS-enabled

## 🔗 CRM Backend Integration

Nova can automatically send call data to your external CRM backend at the end of each call. This is optional and works alongside the existing Notion integration.

### Setup

Add this variable to your `.env` file:

```bash
# CRM Backend Integration (optional)
CRM_BACKEND_URL=https://crm-backend-8b97.onrender.com
CRM_TENANT_CODE=walmart
```

### How it works

At the end of each call, Nova automatically sends contact data to your CRM backend:
- **Endpoint**: `POST {CRM_BACKEND_URL}/public/submit-contact`
- **Authentication**: None (public endpoint)
- **Payload**: Minimal JSON contract required by the public endpoint

Example payload:
```json
{
  "name": "from nova",
  "email": "from nova",
  "phone": "from nova",
  "tenant_code": "walmart",
  "summary": "Caller booked an AI consulting appointment.",
  "escalation_status": "none",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-20T15:30:00Z"
}
```

`escalation_status` reflects the outcome of the call:
- `"none"` — successful booking or completed call with no issues
- `"pending"` — booking failed or caller requested a callback (needs follow-up)
- `"escalated"` — call was transferred to a human agent
- `"resolved"` — issue resolved after escalation

### Error Handling

- Failed CRM pushes are logged but do not crash the call flow
- Both successful and failed attempts are logged in console
- If CRM backend is not configured, it's silently skipped

### Testing

Test your CRM backend integration:
```bash
python test_integrations.py
```
